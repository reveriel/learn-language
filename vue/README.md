### MVVM

Model-view-viewmodel,

```
View(GUI)  <--> ViewModel  <---> Model(Data)
```

What vue does, in my opinion, is do the View <-> ViewModel part.
Developer don't have to fiddle with those DOM objects.


### binding

Usually in a programming language, variable are bound by its name.
We know that two "variable" in one lexical scope are the same variable.

Here, We have a DOM tree in UI, in a form of data.
The code must have some method to find a specific part in DOM.
